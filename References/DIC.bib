Due to the growing number of connected objects and the lack of standardization that meet IoT requirements, discovering and selecting the desirable service is becoming a challenging issue. In the literature, many works have been put forward to address service discovery in IoT. In this paper, we propose a complete classification of these works to provide a more elaborated taxonomy that includes several aspects and criteria. Then, we compare some of the most recent approaches according to several performance criteria, followed with a discussion to set up the future research directions.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovative paradigm envisioned to provide massive applications that are now part of our daily lives. Millions of smart devices are deployed within complex networks to provide vibrant functionalities, including communications, monitoring, and controlling of critical infrastructures. However, this massive growth of IoT devices and the corresponding huge data traffic generated at the edge of the network created additional burdens on the state-of-the-art centralized cloud computing paradigm due to the bandwidth and resource scarcity. Hence, edge computing (EC) is emerging as an innovative strategy that brings data processing and storage near to the end users, leading to what is called the EC-assisted IoT. Although this paradigm provides unique features and enhanced Quality of Service (QoS), it also introduces huge risks in data security and privacy aspects. This article conducts a comprehensive survey on security and privacy issues in the context of EC-assisted IoT. In particular, we first present an overview of EC-assisted IoT, including definitions, applications, architecture, advantages, and challenges. Second, we define security and privacy in the context of EC-assisted IoT. Then, we extensively discuss the major classifications of attacks in EC-assisted IoT and provide possible solutions and countermeasures along with the related research efforts. After that, we further classify some security and privacy issues as discussed in the literature based on security services and based on security objectives and functions. Finally, several open challenges and future research directions for secure EC-assisted IoT paradigm are also extensively provided.},

  abstract = {In the recent past, great attention has been directed toward road surface condition monitoring. As a matter of fact, this activity is of critical importance in transportation infrastructure management. In response, multiple solutions have been proposed which make use of mobile sensing, more specifically contemporary applications and architectures that are used in both crowdsensing and vehicle-based sensing. This has allowed for automated control as well as analysis of road surface quality. These innovations have thus encouraged and showed the importance of cloud to provide reliable transport services to clients. Nonetheless, these initiatives have not been without challenges that range from mobility support, locational awareness, low latency, as well as geo-distribution. As a result, a new term has been coined for this novel paradigm, called, fog computing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol for enhancing security in vehicular crowdsensing-based road surface condition monitoring system using fog computing. At the onset, this paper proposes a certificateless aggregate signcryption scheme that is highly efficient. On the basis of the proposed scheme, a data transmission protocol for monitoring road surface conditions is designed with security aspects such as information confidentiality, mutual authenticity, integrity, privacy, as well as anonymity. In analyzing the system, the ability of the proposed protocol to achieve the set objectives and exercise higher efficiency with respect to computational and communication abilities in comparison to existing systems is also considered.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of the network-enabled devices and communication technologies that allow connectivity and integration of physical objects (Things) into the digital world (Internet). Enormous amounts of dynamic IoT data are collected from Internet-connected devices. IoT data are usually multi-variant streams that are heterogeneous, sporadic, multi-modal, and spatio-temporal. IoT data can be disseminated with different granularities and have diverse structures, types, and qualities. Dealing with the data deluge from heterogeneous IoT resources and services imposes new challenges on indexing, discovery, and ranking mechanisms that will allow building applications that require on-line access and retrieval of ad-hoc IoT data. However, the existing IoT data indexing and discovery approaches are complex or centralised, which hinders their scalability. The primary objective of this article is to provide a holistic overview of the state-of-the-art on indexing, discovery, and ranking of IoT data. The article aims to pave the way for researchers to design, develop, implement, and evaluate techniques and approaches for on-line large-scale distributed IoT applications and services.},

The Internet of Things paradigm is expected to contribute towards this ambitious vision by proposing models and mechanisms enabling the creation of networks of ``smart things'' on a large scale. It is widely recognized that efficient mechanisms for discovering available resources and capabilities are required to realize such vision. The contribution of this work consists in a novel discovery service for the Internet of Things. The proposed solution adopts a peer-to-peer approach for guaranteeing scalability, robustness, and easy maintenance of the overall system. While most existing peer-to-peer discovery services proposed for the IoT support solely exact match queries on a single attribute (i.e., the object identifier), our solution can handle multiattribute and range queries. We defined a layered approach by distinguishing three main aspects: multiattribute indexing, range query support, peer-to-peer routing. We chose to adopt an over-DHT indexing scheme to guarantee ease of design and implementation principles. We report on the implementation of a Proof of Concept in a dangerous goods monitoring scenario, and, finally, we discuss test results for structural properties and query performance evaluation.},

  abstract = {Several distributed system paradigms utilize Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to realize structured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays. DHT structures arise as the most commonly used organizations for peers that can efficiently perform crucial services such as data storage, replication, query resolution, and load balancing. With the advances in various distributed system technologies, novel and efficient solutions based on DHTs emerge and play critical roles in system design. DHT-based methods and communications have been proposed to address challenges such as scalability, availability, reliability and performance, by considering unique characteristics of these technologies. In this article, we propose a classification of the state-of-the-art DHT-based methods focusing on their system architecture, communication, routing and technological aspects across various system domains. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive survey on DHT-based applications from system architecture and communication perspectives that spans various domains of recent distributed system technologies. We investigate the recently emerged DHT-based solutions in the seven key domains of edge and fog computing, cloud computing, blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), Online Social Networks (OSNs), Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). In contrast to the existing surveys, our study goes beyond the commonly known DHT methods such as storage, routing, and lookup, and identifies diverse DHT-based solutions including but not limited to aggregation, task scheduling, resource management and discovery, clustering and group management, federation, data dependency management, and data transmission. Furthermore, we identify open problems and discuss future research guidelines for each domain.},

Several researchers have proposed different approaches to reduce privacy risks. However, most of the existing solutions still suffer from various drawbacks, such as huge bandwidth utilization and network latency, heavyweight cryptosystems, and policies that are applied on sensor devices and in the cloud. To address these issues, fog computing has been introduced for IoT network edges providing low latency, computation, and storage services. In this survey, we comprehensively review and classify privacy requirements for an in-depth understanding of privacy implications in IoT applications. Based on the classification, we highlight ongoing research efforts and limitations of the existing privacy-preservation techniques and map the existing IoT schemes with Fog-enabled IoT schemes to elaborate on the benefits and improvements that Fog-enabled IoT can bring to preserve data privacy in IoT applications.

We introduce Learned Secondary Index (LSI), a first attempt to use learned indexes for indexing unsorted data. LSI works by building a learned index over a permutation vector, which allows binary search to performed on the unsorted base data using random access. We additionally augment LSI with a fingerprint vector to accelerate equality lookups. We show that LSI achieves comparable lookup performance to state-of-the-art secondary indexes while being up to 6\texttimes{} more space efficient.},

Thus, the efficient indexing and searching of large data collections is a very topical and urgent issue. Such solutions can provide users with valuable information about IoT data. However, efficient retrieval and management of such information in terms of index size and search time require optimization of indexing schemes which is rather difficult to implement. The purpose of this paper is to examine and review existing indexing techniques for large-scale data. A taxonomy of indexing techniques is proposed to enable researchers to understand and select the techniques that will serve as a basis for designing a new indexing scheme. The real-world applications of the existing indexing techniques in different areas, such as health, business, scientific experiments, and social networks, are presented.

  abstract = {Indexes are models: a B-Tree-Index can be seen as a model to map a key to the position of a record within a sorted array, a Hash-Index as a model to map a key to a position of a record within an unsorted array, and a BitMap-Index as a model to indicate if a data record exists or not. In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term learned indexes. The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of lookup keys and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records.

In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term learned indexes.

  abstract = {Sorting is one of the most fundamental algorithms in Computer Science and a common operation in databases not just for sorting query results but also as part of joins (i.e., sort-merge-join) or indexing. In this work, we introduce a new type of distribution sort that leverages a learned model of the empirical CDF of the data. Our algorithm uses a model to efficiently get an approximation of the scaled empirical CDF for each record key and map it to the corresponding position in the output array. We then apply a deterministic sorting algorithm that works well on nearly-sorted arrays (e.g., Insertion Sort) to establish a totally sorted order. We compared this algorithm against common sorting approaches and measured its performance for up to 1 billion normally-distributed double-precision keys. The results show that our approach yields an average 3.38x performance improvement over C++ STL sort, which is an optimized Quicksort hybrid, 1.49x improvement over sequential Radix Sort, and 5.54x improvement over a C++ implementation of Timsort, which is the default sorting function for Java and Python.},

The emerging vehicular applications and the exponential growing data have naturally led to the increased needs of communication, computation and storage resources, and also to strict performance requirements on response time and network bandwidth. In order to deal with these challenges, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is regarded as a promising solution. MEC pushes powerful computational and storage capacities from the remote cloud to the edge of networks in close proximity of vehicular users, which enables low latency and reduced bandwidth consumption. Driven by the benefits of MEC, many efforts have been devoted to integrating vehicular networks into MEC, thereby forming a novel paradigm named as Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of state-of-art research on VEC. First of all, we provide an overview of VEC, including the introduction, architecture, key enablers, advantages, challenges as well as several attractive application scenarios. Then, we describe several typical research topics where VEC is applied. After that, we present a careful literature review on existing research work in VEC by classification. Finally, we identify open research issues and discuss future research directions.},

However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking. In this survey, we firstly introduce the impact of edge computing on the development of IoT and point out why edge computing is more suitable for IoT than other computing paradigms. Then, we analyze the necessity of systematical investigation on the edge-computing-driven IoT (ECDriven-IoT) and summarize new challenges occurred in ECDriven-IoT. We categorize recent advances from bottom to top, covering six aspects of ECDriven-IoT. Finally, we conclude lessons learned and propose some challenging and worthwhile research directions.},

  abstract = {Safety is the most important requirement for autonomous vehicles; hence, the ultimate challenge of designing an edge computing ecosystem for autonomous vehicles is to deliver enough computing power, redundancy, and security so as to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, autonomous driving systems are extremely complex; they tightly integrate many technologies, including sensing, localization, perception, decision making, as well as the smooth interactions with cloud platforms for high-definition (HD) map generation and data storage. These complexities impose numerous challenges for the design of autonomous driving edge computing systems. First, edge computing systems for autonomous driving need to process an enormous amount of data in real time, and often the incoming data from different sensors are highly heterogeneous. Since autonomous driving edge computing systems are mobile, they often have very strict energy consumption restrictions. Thus, it is imperative to deliver sufficient computing power with reasonable energy consumption, to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles, even at high speed. Second, in addition to the edge system design, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) provides redundancy for autonomous driving workloads and alleviates stringent performance and energy constraints on the edge side. With V2X, more research is required to define how vehicles cooperate with each other and the infrastructure. Last, safety cannot be guaranteed when security is compromised. Thus, protecting autonomous driving edge computing systems against attacks at different layers of the sensing and computing stack is of paramount concern. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art approaches in these areas as well as explore potential solutions to address these challenges.},

It specifies the structure of the network and the exchange of information through node lookups. With the unique identifying pattern of nodes which kademlia adopts and XOR metric for distance, it contacts only O(log(n)) nodes during the search out of the total of n nodes in the system. The neighboring nodes in the network based on Kademlia are not always physical neighbours so that the delay between nodes is affected. In this paper, we put forward to a new model of Kademlia based on physical information. It re-construct the Kademlia model reasonably with the idea of making the nodes which are closed in physical network approach in the network in the logic topology. As a result, it will lower routing delay. We describes the structure and its query routing algorithm. Our query routing strategies are proved effective in our case studies mentioned in this paper.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, a metric space is a set together with a notion of distance between its elements, usually called points.  The distance is measured by a function called a metric or distance function.  Metric spaces are the most general setting for studying many of the concepts of mathematical analysis and geometry. The most familiar example of a metric space is 3-dimensional Euclidean space with its usual notion of distance.  Other well-known examples are a sphere equipped with the angular distance and the hyperbolic plane.  A metric may correspond to a metaphorical, rather than physical, notion of distance: for example, the set of 100-character Unicode strings can be equipped with the Hamming distance, which measures the number of characters that need to be changed to get from one string to another. Since they are very general, metric spaces are a tool used in many different branches of mathematics.  Many types of mathematical objects have a natural notion of distance and therefore admit the structure of a metric space, including Riemannian manifolds, normed vector spaces, and graphs.  In abstract algebra, the p-adic numbers arise as elements of the completion of a metric structure on the rational numbers.  Metric spaces are also studied in their own right in metric geometry and analysis on metric spaces.Many of the basic notions of mathematical analysis, including balls, completeness, as well as uniform, Lipschitz, and H\"older continuity, can be defined in the setting of metric spaces.  Other notions, such as continuity, compactness, and open and closed sets, can be defined for metric spaces, but also in the even more general setting of topological spaces.},

Massive amounts of data are generated every day from billions of GPS-enabled devices such as cell phones, cars, sensors, and various consumerbased applications such as Uber, Tinder, location-tagged posts in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. This exponential growth in spatial data has led the research community to focus on building systems and applications that can process spatial data efficiently. In the meantime, recent research has introduced learned index structures. In this work, we use techniques proposed from a state-of-the art learned multi-dimensional index structure (namely, Flood) and apply them to five classical multi-dimensional indexes to be able to answer spatial range queries. By tuning each partitioning technique for optimal performance, we show that (i) machine learned search within a partition is faster by 11.79\% to 39.51\% than binary search when using filtering on one dimension, (ii) the bottleneck for tree structures is index lookup, which could potentially be improved by linearizing the indexed partitions (iii) filtering on one dimension and refining using machine learned indexes is 1.23x to 1.83x times faster than closest competitor which filters on two dimensions, and (iv) learned indexes can have a significant impact on the performance of low selectivity queries while being less effective under higher selectivities.},

With the development of information technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) as an emerging technology has been entered into a lane of development. With the advent of IoT, data sharing, and connections among systems, devices, and people have been facilitated, and daily devices have been equipped with sensors and applications to provide their functionality through services. As a matter of fact, IoT provides a platform where everyday objects become smarter than before, everyday communication becomes informative, and everyday processes become intelligent. In this regard, to provide novel IoT services, numerous heterogeneous frameworks and protocols have been proposed. Since the number of IoT devices or objects is growing day by day, and the number of services is also increasing, discovering and locating appropriate services becomes a vital challenge, and the traditional service discovery strategies are not efficient enough to handle this issue. Service discovery refers to the process of finding suitable services according to clients' requests. Although the service discovery problem has essential impacts on the IoT, there is not any detailed and systematic study of the existing methods in this field. Therefore, this paper aims to find, categorize, and investigate all the effective and valid papers in the field of service discovery in the IoT using a systematic method. The selected papers are discussed based on various service discovery metrics and other criteria such as adopted architecture, search method, service description, discovery scope, adopted simulation tools, and datasets. The advantages and weaknesses of each reviewed paper are specified. Moreover, an abreast comparison of the selected papers is presented, in which the aforementioned methods are evaluated considering the mentioned metrics and criteria. Finally, future research directions and challenging problems are outlined to help researchers improve their innovations.},

Fog nodes are used to generate and release the crowdsourcing tasks, and cooperatively find the optimal route according to the real-time traffic information collected by vehicles in their coverage areas. Meanwhile, the vehicle performing the crowdsourcing task can get a reasonable reward. The querying vehicle can retrieve the navigation results from each fog node successively when entering its coverage area, and follow the optimal route to the next fog node until it reaches the desired destination. Our scheme fulfills the security and privacy requirements of authentication, confidentiality and conditional privacy preservation. Some cryptographic primitives, including the Elgamal encryption algorithm, AES, randomized anonymous credentials and group signatures, are adopted to achieve this goal. Finally, we analyze the security and the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and the success of rich cloud services have pushed the horizon of a new computing paradigm, edge computing, which calls for processing the data at the edge of the network. Edge computing has the potential to address the concerns of response time requirement, battery life constraint, bandwidth cost saving, as well as data safety and privacy. In this paper, we introduce the definition of edge computing, followed by several case studies, ranging from cloud offloading to smart home and city, as well as collaborative edge to materialize the concept of edge computing. Finally, we present several challenges and opportunities in the field of edge computing, and hope this paper will gain attention from the community and inspire more research in this direction.},

  abstract = {Edge computing promises a dramatic reduction in the network latency and the traffic volume, where many edge servers are placed at the edge of the Internet. Furthermore, these edge servers cache data to provide services for edge users. The data sharing among edge servers can effectively shorten the latency to retrieve the data and further reduce the network bandwidth consumption. The key challenge is to construct an efficient data indexing mechanism no matter how the data is cached in the edge network. Although this is essential, it is still an open problem. Moreover, existing methods such as the centralized indexing and the DHT indexing in other fields fail to meet the performance demand of edge computing. This paper presents a COordinate-based INdexing (COIN) mechanism for the data sharing in edge computing. COIN maintains a virtual space where the switches and the data indexes are associated with the coordinates. Then, COIN distributes data indexes to indexing edge servers based on those coordinates. The COIN is effective because any query request from an edge server can be responded when the data has been stored in the edge network. More importantly, COIN is efficient in both routing path lengths and forwarding table sizes for publishing/querying the data indexes. We implement COIN in a P4 prototype. Experimental results show that COIN uses 59\% shorter path length and 30\% less forwarding table entries to retrieve the data index compared to using Chord, a well-known DHT solution.},

We classify all related aspects, general steps, and requirements to construct a novel resource discovery solution in three categories consisting of structures, methods, and issues. Accordingly, we review the literature, analyzing various aspects for each category.},

  abstract = {With the explosive growth of Internet of Things devices and massive data produced at the edge of the network, the traditional centralized cloud computing model has come to a bottleneck due to the bandwidth limitation and resources constraint. Therefore, edge computing, which enables storing and processing data at the edge of the network, has emerged as a promising technology in recent years. However, the unique features of edge computing, such as content perception, real-time computing, and parallel processing, has also introduced several new challenges in the field of data security and privacy-preserving, which are also the key concerns of the other prevailing computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, mobile cloud computing, and fog computing. Despites its importance, there still lacks a survey on the recent research advance of data security and privacy-preserving in the field of edge computing. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the data security and privacy threats, protection technologies, and countermeasures inherent in edge computing. Specifically, we first make an overview of edge computing, including forming factors, definition, architecture, and several essential applications. Next, a detailed analysis of data security and privacy requirements, challenges, and mechanisms in edge computing are presented. Then, the cryptography-based technologies for solving data security and privacy issues are summarized. The state-of-the-art data security and privacy solutions in edge-related paradigms are also surveyed. Finally, we propose several open research directions of data security in the field of edge computing.},

The paper presents the Tapestry architecture, algorithms, and implementation. It explores the behavior of a Tapestry deployment on PlanetLab, a global testbed of approximately 100 machines. Experimental results show that Tapestry exhibits stable behavior and performance as an overlay, despite the instability of the underlying network layers. Several widely distributed applications have been implemented on Tapestry, illustrating its utility as a deployment infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) aims to minimize human intervention and to adapt the behavior of systems to the user's needs. Achieving this vision involves the abstraction of IoT objects resources as services and the composition of these services. A major obstacle to the use of services is the discovery and selection of these services. Due to the excessive number of connected objects searching and discovering specific services offered by these objects is becoming a challenging task. The use of traditional solution of service discovery is non-practical for IoT due to its scale and complexity. Enabling an easy and seamless discovery of these IoT services is crucial for the success of IoT. Resource discovery in IoT has captured much attention in both academia and industry. Therefore, many architectures and frameworks have been proposed to provide solutions for its issues. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art study of service discovery methods in IoT systems, classifying them according to their search approaches and providing a comparison of the selected works. Equally, we identify and discuss key challenges and future research directions that will support the success of IoT.},
