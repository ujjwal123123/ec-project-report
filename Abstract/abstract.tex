    In this project, we are working on the problem of secure data access in the
    edge computing environment. Specifically, we are interested in the methods
    for resource discovery in edge while preserving the data privacy. We study how
    Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and Learned Index Structures have been used
    by researchers to solve similar problems in other domains. In our work, we
    are considering using the XOR based routing algorithm used in Kademlia, a
    kind of Distributed Hash Table. Though Kademlia is generally used for the
    storage and retrieval of data, we are considering using only the routing
    algorithm used in Kademlia. For retrieval itself, we are interested in
    Learned Index Structures (LIS), which have been gaining popularity lately.
